Assembly Instructions
=====================

As we do not provide ready-to-use assembled CamAdapter, the end user is to assemble it himself.

**Attention**: There are some parts which should be manufactured using 3D-printer. Also, there are cover boards which are to be milled with CNC machine or ordered as PCB.
